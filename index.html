                    <p>Hi my name is David Lawrence I live in Vermilion, OH and I am thirty-three years old. For the past thirteen years 
                        I have worked as an irrigation technician seven of those have been spent helping operate a small family business, 
                        but I have reached the point where I need a major change in my life. I do not have a college education, but I do have a great work 
                        ethic and determination to prove myself going toward.
                        A little bit about myself; I have been married for going on twelve years with no children, apparently people have a hard time understanding this. 
                        I enjoy learning and teaching myself new skill, so I have plenty of hobbies including sailing, home-brewing beer, and woodworking just to name a few. 
                        I also enjoying being outdoors in the spring and summer whether out on the water, walking my big fluffy dog, or just relaxing in the fresh air. 
                        I would consider myself a shy person, but not an introvert. Once my comfort level with people increases my personality comes out. I am an easy-going 
                        positive person who likes to please the people around him, and I typically put other people before myself helping anyway possible. Iâ€™m sure there is 
                        so much more to say, but who has that kind of time to write or read it all. 
                    </p>
