                    <p>Working in a labor focused profession for the past decade most of which as a co-operator of a small business 
                        has given me the ability to meet deadlines, work with many companies and teams to accomplish one common goal, and understand 
                        what hard work means. This has pushed me to pursue a career in which I have always had a secret crush on as a developer, 
                        Which has led me to the joining a coding bootcamp. Attending a coding bootcamp has given me 
                        exposure to styling using CSS, and experience using javaScript.  I enjoy troubleshooting, and figuring out when, 
                        why, and how things are working while learning and taking is as much information as possible. I would consider myself 
                        a hard worker who is willing to put in max effort and time on projects, whether by myself or in a group.
                        I am looking forward to earning a position with a company as a developer, paying my dues, and continuing to advance my knowledge within the field.
