                    <p>Working in a labor focused profession for the past decade most of which as a co-operator of a small business 
                        has given me the ability to meet deadlines, work with many groups to accomplish one common goal, and understand 
                        what hard work means. Pushing me to pursue a career in which I have always had a secret crush on as a developer, 
                        I have done well with front end design matching code to design styles. Attending a coding bootcamp has given me 
                        more exposure styling using CSS, and experience using javaScript.  I enjoy troubleshooting, and figuring out when, 
                        why, and how things are working while learning and intaking as much information as possible. I would consider myself 
                        a hard worker who is willing to put in max effort and time on projects, whether by myself or in a group.
                         For this reason I am looking forward to paying my dues while learning and honing my craft going forward.
